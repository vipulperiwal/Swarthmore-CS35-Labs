\section{AVL Trees}

\noindent \textbf{Problem 1.} Perform a left rotation on the root of the following tree.  Be sure to specify the X, Y, and Z subtrees used in the rotation.
\input{written-trees/problem1.1}
\vspace{1em}

\noindent X subtree---rooted at 4\\
Y subtree---rooted at 6\\
Z subtree---rooted at 8

\input{written-trees/problem1.1Rot} % This is a lot like a #include in C++: it brings in the contents of problem1.1.tex and puts it here.

\noindent \textbf{Problem 2.} Show the right rotation of the subtree rooted at 27.  Be sure to specify the X, Y, and Z subtrees used in the rotation.
\input{written-trees/problem1.2}
\vspace{1em}

\noindent X subtree---rooted at 21\\
Y subtree---rooted at 24\\
X subtree---rooted at 30

\input{written-trees/problem1.2Rot}

\noindent \textbf{Problem 3.} Using the appropriate AVL tree algorithm, insert the value 12 into the following tree.  Show the tree before and after rebalancing.
\input{written-trees/problem1.3}
\vspace{1em}

Before rebalancing:\\
\input{written-trees/problem1.3-preReb}

After rebalancing:\\
\input{written-trees/problem1.3-postReb}

\noindent \textbf{Problem 4.} Using the appropriate AVL tree algorithm, remove the value 54 from the following tree.  Show the tree before and after rebalancing.
\vspace{1em}

\input{written-trees/problem1.4}

Before rebalancing:\\
\input{written-trees/problem1.4-preReb}

After rebalancing:\\

\section{Heaps}

\noindent \textbf{Problem 1.} Show the addition of the element 9 to the max-heap below.  First, show the addition of 9 to the tree; then, show each bubbling step.


\input{written-trees/problem2.1}
Addition of 9:
\input{written-trees/problem2.1-preBub}
Bubbling step 1:
\input{written-trees/problem2.1-bub1}
Bubbling step 2:
\input{written-trees/problem2.1-bub2}

\noindent \textbf{Problem 2.} Show the removal of the top element of this max-heap.  First, show the swap of the root node; then, show each bubbling step.

\input{written-trees/problem2.2}
Swap:
\input{written-trees/problem2.2-swap}
Removing right-most leaf after swap:
\input{written-trees/problem2.2-cut}
Bubbling step 1:
\input{written-trees/problem2.2-bub1}
Bubbling step 2:

\input{written-trees/problem2.2-bub2}
Bubbling step 3:

\input{written-trees/problem2.2-bub3}
Bubbling step 4:

\input{written-trees/problem2.2-bub4}
Bubbling step 5:

\input{written-trees/problem2.2-bub5}
Bubbling step 6:

\input{written-trees/problem2.2-bub6}


\noindent \textbf{Problem 3.} Consider the sequence of elements \texttt{[5,4,2,3,2,8,5]}.  Using the representation discussed in class, show the tree to which this sequence corresponds.  Then, show the \textit{heapification} of this tree; that is, show how this tree is transformed into a heap.  Demonstrate each bubbling step.
